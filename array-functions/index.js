     Question 1

        Mutating array methods are operations that can be performed on an 
        array that completely changes it.

        Examples of methods that can mutate an array;
        a. array.push()
        b. array.shift()
        c. array.splice()
        d. array.sort()
        e. array.unshift()

        Non-mutating array methods are operations that can be performed without 
        changing the array.

        Examples of non-mutating array methods;
        a.  array.slice()
        b.  array.map()
        c.  array.filter()
        d.  array.concat()
